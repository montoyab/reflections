When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    My most common use of remote repositories is when I'm collaborating with
    other people on a project.  I also use them when I want to share my code
    with someone, even if they just want to see my code and not contribute to
    it.  I also sometimes use them when I want to be able to edit code from
    multiple different computers and keep the code up-to-date on all the
    computers.  Also, remotes can be a good way to keep a backup of my work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I like pulling changes manually because that way, when I'm working on code,
    it doesn't change without me expecting it.  For example, if I know the new
    version of some code is broken, I might not want to pull that change until I
    the bug is fixed.
